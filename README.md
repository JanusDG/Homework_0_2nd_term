# Homework_0_2nd_term
This is a coursework for fisrt year students in Ukrainian Catholic University

## Description:
Currrent project's goal is to work with Deezer API and make a research via some statistics of the music database and present it as the easy to use interface that will display requested statistics. Also the additiondal purpore of our project is to see the accuracy of detecting the popularity of a track and other parameters using machine learning python libs.

## Purpose and brief description of the program
Current research's goal is no analyze the stats of tracks on the Deezer platform. Also we analyze tendencies, genres and other stuff that is related to music.

## Input and output data of the program
Using Deezer Api, we created the nessesary json files for our research and then, afler processing the data, we wrote all the datasets needed for final realization into another json and csv files.

## The structure of the program with a brief description of the modules, functions, classes and methods.
### General description
The main module allow you to experience one of two parts of the research. The more detailed descriptions for both of them are written in the module's descriptions. The first one will show you different statistics of genres, charts and else. The second one will show the level of dependency beteween different properties of tracks with their popylarity.
### Functions', classes' and methods's description
For this research we created an ATD that has the identical structure that python dict has (it was done only in educational purposes). The ATD uses keys for getting to the values of the container. It has iterration and supports other interactions with data as the python dict has. For this to be implemented in our project, there is a function that transforms the python dict into our dict. Using the json module, json files into our dict as well.

## Short instructions for using the program
There is no need for detailed instructions, because they are given in the modules after running them. Despite it, talking shortly, after you run the 'main.py' module you will be able to chose the mode for the program and then the further instructions will be given.

## Description of test examples for testing program performance.
There is no way the program could be tested(except directly running it), because of collecting data from the API and not having the opportunity to check the correctness of the research's analisys.

## Installation: 
All files are presented in developing stage yet, so the result of progect will be performed as web app or the database of all graphics and numbers that was got during the research.

## Usage:
After the developing stage will be finished all instructions will be added to the customer interface.
